# AiJigsawpuzzleBuddy
## Summary

AiJigsawpuzzleBuddy will allow you to make a picture of your puzzle pieces along with the partly finished puzzle. Based on this picture it will generate an advice on placement of a next puzzle piece.

Final project for the Building AI course

## Background

You might get stuck while trying to complete a puzzle, none of the pieces seem to fit! You might ask a friend or a family member to help you. However, most people seem to really dislike your hobby. This is where AiJigsawpuzzleBuddy comes to the rescue!

## How is it used?

You make a picture of the puzzle pieces along with the partly finished puzzle.

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
